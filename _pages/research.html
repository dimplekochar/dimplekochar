  <li><p><strong>Modelling of MOS Device Reliability</strong> - <i> Device Physics </i> (Jul '18 - Present) <br /> 
  <em>Advisor: Prof. Souvik Mahapatra, Electrical Engineering , IIT Bombay</em> <br /> 
<ul>
  <p><li>Stress Induced Leakage Current (SILC) and Positive Bias Temperature Instability (PBTI) in High-K Metal Gate (HKMG) MOSFETs</li></p>
  Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) remained as the forerunner in the device reliability
domain with the continuous transistor scaling; PBTI remains a concern for N-MOSFETs. Bulk trap generation in HK for PBTI stress
is estimated from SILC measurements.
  <ul>
        <p><p><li>
         Utilized a Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) tunneling model for modelling SILC measurements of 7 wafers made through different preclean, pre and post HK Ashbury processes, and different IL and HK thicknesses
      </li>
    <li>
    Extracted the bulk trap densities (N<sub>OT</sub>) in these wafers & used a Reaction-Diffusion-Drift (RDD) framework to model them 
     </li>
    <li>
    Modelling the interface trap density (N<sub>IT</sub>) generated from PBTI stress using the double interface H/H<sub>2</sub> RD model
    </li></p></p>
      </ul>
  
 <p><li> Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) of ultrathin oxides</li></p>
  TDDB is a failure mechanism in MOSFETs, when the gate oxide breaks down as a result of long-time application of relatively low electric field.
  <ul>
        <p><p><li>Constructed a cell based MOSFET percolation model which generates bulk and interface traps with varied defect generation rates
and procured the time at which a percolation path emerges using Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm
      </li>
      <li>
        Procured the time to failure distribution from above model & analysed the relation of its Weibull slope with oxide thicknes

  <li><p><strong>Dipole-Exchange Spin Waves for Thin Ferromagnetic Films</strong> - <i> Spintronics </i> (May '19 - Jul '19) <a href="https://dimplekochar.github.io/files/delft.pdf">[Presentation]</a>
  <br /> <em>Advisors: Prof. Gerrit Bauer, Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Applied Sciences, TU Delft</em> <br />
    <em> &emsp; &emsp; Prof. Yaroslav Blanter, Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Applied Sciences, TU Delft</em> <br />
    Surface spin waves (dipole) are chiral and exist only in thick magnetic films with small group velocities. Exchange waves are non chiral with high velocities at higher frequencies.
      Dipole-exchange spin waves exist in the middle of these two ends of wave vector range.
      <ul>
        <p><p><li>
        Solved the Landau–Lifshitz equation and obtained dispersion relations (&omega; vs k) for a given film thickness
      </li>
      <li>
        Obtained the wave function, the magnetization and dipolar field profiles for various modes given wave vector
          and film thickness
        </li>
    <li>
        Discussed properties like chirality for different wave vectors and curving of isofrequency plots

  <li><p><strong>Time to Failure Distribution of a Stored Bit in SRAM due to RTN</strong>  - <i> Circuits & CAD </i> (Jan '19 - Present) <br /> 
  <em>Advisor: Prof. Animesh Kumar, Electrical Engineering , IIT Bombay</em> <br /> 
Trapped charges in the oxide interface of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) affect the reliability of operation. Trapping and detrapping
    of charges leads to a random telegraphic noise (RTN) injection and this phenomenon affects the reliability of circuits.
    <!-- <a href="https://github.com/dimplekochar/Butler_Matrix">[files]</a> -->
  <ul>
        <p><p><li>
    Acquired time to failure distribution of a stored bit in an SRAM cell by the composition of Monte-Carlo simulations and circuit-level abstraction of an SRAM cell
        </li>
      <li>
        Showcased results of proposed estimation procedure for 45nm CMOS technology, with RTN due to a single-trap model, using Cadence Virtuoso
        </li>
    <li>
    Examined the effect of process variations, via circuit-level simulations and found the distribution to worsen
