  <li><p><strong>HKMG Stack Process Impact on Gate Leakage, SILC and PBTI</strong> [May '18 - Present] <br /> 
  <em>Advisor: Prof. Souvik Mahapatra, Electrical Engineering , IIT Bombay</em> <br /> 
  Stress Induced Leakage Current (SILC) and Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) remained as the forerunner in the device reliability domain with the continuous transistor 
    scaling; PBTI remains a concern for N-MOSFETs. Bulk trap generation in HK for PBTI stress is estimated from SILC measurements. Recently, RD and RDD models are used for NBTI interface and bulk
trap generation in PMOS.<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8330761">*</a>
 This project aims to model direct tunneling leakage, SILC and PBTI along
with the bulk traps generated and PBTI trap generation at IL/HK interface in NMOS with deeply scaled (down to EOT∼7Å) HKMG stacks.

  <li><p><strong>Time to Failure Distribution of a Stored Bit in SRAM due to RTN</strong>  [Dec '18 - Present] <br /> 
  <em>Advisor: Prof. Animesh Kumar, Electrical Engineering , IIT Bombay</em> <br /> 
   Trapping and detrapping of charges in the oxide interface of a MOSFET leads to a
random telegraphic noise (RTN) injection and this phenomenon negatively affects the reliability of
circuits. The objective of this project is to develop a reproducible strategy to obtain TTF distribution
and related statistics for an SRAM cell of any technology with any given RTN model.
  <ul>
        <p><p><li>
    Proposed a method to estimate TTF distribution of a stored bit in an SRAM cell due to single
or multi-level RTN by composition of Monte-Carlo simulations and circuit-level abstraction    </li>
      <li>
    Showcased results of this procedure on an SRAM cell made from 45 nm technology with a single-
trap RTN model at various supply voltages using Cadence, Ocean and Python scripting    </li>
    <li>
   Indicated via circuit-level simulations that the TTF distribution worsens due to process variations

<li><p><strong>Dipole-Exchange Spin Waves for Thin Ferromagnetic Films</strong> [May '19 - Jul '19] <a href="https://dimplekochar.github.io/files/delft.pdf">[Presentation]</a>

    Surface spin waves (dipole) are chiral and exist only in thick magnetic films with small group velocities. Exchange waves are non chiral with high velocities at higher frequencies.
      Dipole-exchange spin waves exist in the middle of these two ends of wave vector range. Dispersion characteristics of spin waves in ferromagnetic films taking into account both
the dipole-dipole and the exchange interactions are obtained by a sixth-order differential equation. The objective of this project is to solve it considering pinned and unpinned boundary conditions and
study their variation with thickness in this transition region.

waves for given film thickness by solving Landau–Lifshitz and Maxwells’ equations and appropriate boundary conditions</li>
    <li>

      omega; vs k&#8407;) for a film

 <p><li><strong> Model for Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) for ultrathin oxides</strong> [May '18 - Present] <br /> </li></p>
<em>Advisor: Prof. Souvik Mahapatra, Electrical Engineering , IIT Bombay</em> <br /> 
  
  TDDB is a failure mechanism in MOSFETs, when the gate oxide breaks down as a result of long-time application of relatively low electric field. 
Time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) follows the Weibull distribution and is characterized by &#946;, the Weibull slope.
In this project, the change in the slope is explained by a percolation model with different defect
generation rates in the bulk and channel/oxide and gate/oxide interfaces, also considering SILC slope and trap size
changes with thickness. The model is then extended for high-k with interfacial SiO<sub>2</sub>.
  <ul>
        <p><p><li>Constructed a cell based MOSFET percolation model which generates bulk and interface traps with varied defect generation rates
and procured the time at which a percolation path emerges using Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm in C++
      </li>
      <li>
    Obtained time to failure distribution and analysed the relation of its Weibull slope with oxide
thickness and obtained results obeying empirical claims and experimental data; verified area scaling
    </li>
    <li>
      Extending the model to a bilayer stack and including the effect of PBTI generated interface traps
