I’m currently a fifth year Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) student at the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay. My research interests lie in the areas of nanoelectronics and circuits. 

I will be joining the PhD program in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Fall 2021.

I’m fortunate to have [Prof. Souvik Mahapatra](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/souvik?s=model) as my Master’s Thesis advisor. We are working on electrical characterization, modeling and simulation of Stress Induced Leakage Current (SILC), Positive Bias Temperature Instability (PBTI) and other reliability concerns in micro/nano electronic devices. Apart from it, we are also trying to model Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) of very thin oxides using a percolation model. 

I spent a summer at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), where I was hosted by [Prof. Gerrit Bauer](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/quantum-nanoscience/prof-dr-gerrit-bauer/) and [Prof. Yaroslav Blanter](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/quantum-nanoscience/prof-dr-yaroslav-blanter/), at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience. We worked on dipole-exchange spin waves for thin ferromagnetic films.  

I have also worked with [Prof. Animesh Kumar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~animesh/) on an independent study project. We developed a method to obtain the time to failure distribution for an SRAM cell with a given RTN model.
