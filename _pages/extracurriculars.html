<ol><li><p><strong>Department Academic Mentor</strong> (Apr  ’19 - Present) <br /> 
  <em>Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay</em> <br /> 
I was selected as a student mentor, through extensive peer reviews and interviews, to help weak students to improve and maximize the academic potential of all students. I am also obligated to identify problems of the general student populace and bring them to the notice of the concerned authorities. Last year, I was responsible for mentoring and motivating 4 students and playing a key role in their overall development. This year I am responsible for 9 students. 

  <li><p><strong>Editor</strong> (Apr ’18 - Mar ’19) <br /> 
  <em>Insight, IIT Bombay</em> <br /> 
Insight is the official print student media body of IIT Bombay, circulated to 10,000+ students and 650+ faculty members with an online readership of over 0.4 million. I was part of the 22 member team responsible for managing Insight.
