<p><strong>Monitoring Honking Rate to reduce Noise Pollution </strong>- Electronic Design [Jan '19 - May '19] <br /> 
  <em>Wadhwani Lab, EE, IITB</em> <br /> 
<ul>
 Built a device to count a specific vehicle’s honks by an amplitude-frequency threshold circuit amid all the traffic noise, 
  which can be calibrated before for the specific vehicle's horn
 Transmitted this data to a server using ESP8266 wirelessly and provided for detection if the device is tampered with to hide honk count;
  can be used to monitor honking rate of a driver by authorities and take action
