<ol><li><p><strong>Music Genre Identification</strong> (Feb '18 - May '18) <br /> 
  <em>Advisor: Prof. Preethi Jyothi, CSE, IITB</em> <br /> 
Researched and found that the timbre feature corresponding to the loudest parts of the song gives
better clustering of audio samples and implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to show it
Contrived Bayesian Optimization for tuning of hyperparameters to compute posterior probability
loss; utilized Gini Index for splitting at each node in Random Forests
Achieved an accuracy of 56% and an F1 score of 50.65% using the Random Forest algorithm
